/*
 *  Palindrome Number
 *      Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.
 *
 *      click to show spoilers.
 *
 *      Some hints:
 *      Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)
 *
 *      If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
 *
 *      You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
 *
 *      There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
